abstract: >-
  Logs record the behavioral data of running programs and are typically generated by executing log statements. Software developers generally carry out logging practices with clear intentions and associated concerns (_I&Cs_). However, _I&Cs_ may not be properly fulfilled in source code as log placement--specifically determination of a log statement's context and content--is often susceptible to an individual's profile and experience. Some industrial studies have been conducted to discern developers' main logging _I&Cs_ and the way _I&Cs_ are fulfilled. However, the findings are only based on the developers from a single company in each individual study and hence have limited generalizability. More importantly, there lacks a comprehensive and deep understanding of the relationships between developers' profiles and experiences and their logging practices from a wider perspective. To fill this significant gap, we conducted an empirical study using mixed methods comprising questionnaire surveys, semi-structured interviews, and code analyses with practitioners from a wide range of companies across a variety of industrial domains. Results reveal that while developers share common logging _I&Cs_ and conduct logging practices mainly in the coding stage, their profiles and experiences profoundly influence their logging _I&Cs_ and the way the _I&Cs_ are fulfilled. These findings pave the way to facilitate the acceptance of important logging _I&Cs_ and the adoption of good logging practices by developers.
