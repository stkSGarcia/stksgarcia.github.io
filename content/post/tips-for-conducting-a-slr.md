-   Identify relations, contradictions, gaps, and inconsistencies in the literature, and explore reasons for these (e.g., by proposing a new conceptualisation or theory which accounts for the inconsistency);
-   Formulate general statements or an overarching conceptualization (make a point, rather than summarizing all the points everyone else has made; Sternberg, 1991);
-   Comment on, evaluate, extend, or develop theory;
-   In doing these things, provide implications for practice and policy;
-   Describe directions for future research.
